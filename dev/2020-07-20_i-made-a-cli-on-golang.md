So I recently started coding on golang. Though the learning was not hard as I was pretty familiar with programming concepts, I thought why not put the new found knowledge in use. So I made a cli app called [projecto](https://github.com/rubiin/projecto), a CLI which lets you add projects to favorites using command pm add and open them from anywhere you want using command `projecto --open`.Its actually a work in progress so I am open to suggestion. Also, I have tried to use the native packages as much as possible (except the TUI). Let me know what you think and star if you like :) .
