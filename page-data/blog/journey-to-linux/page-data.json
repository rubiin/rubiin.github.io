The Operating system is actually GNU/ Linux (I assume you already know that) . But for the sake of simplicity I will be address it with Linux.</p>\n<p>On mid of december 2010, I booted into windows for the last time as my primary OS. From then on, my primary computing environment - at least on a laptop computer - was GNU/Linux. It was not a quick decision but a result of millions rolled eyeball and torture I faced while I was using windows.</p>\n<p>First of all , Windows was/is not free, you have to throw few hundred bills just to get the windows licence which was was hard to come by for college students like me back at the time.

I wanted to start with something noob friendly and ubuntu became the first Linux distro I got to play with.\nAs I was acquainted with the click and install thing on windows in the past, the first few days was uneasy with the commands but after that, I got hang of it (perks of being a dev) and was happy terminal user. Linux opened a whole new opportunities and platform\nHere are the few reasons that I love linux:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Updates aren't a headache.
