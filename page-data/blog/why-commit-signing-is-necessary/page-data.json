That's where commit signing comes into play and helps to mitigate this.</p>\n<p>Signing a commit involves using your private key to create a unique digital fingerprint, or signature, for that commit. This signature is like a stamp that only your private key can create. When you share your public key with platforms such as GitHub, they can use it to verify the signature on your commits. This verification process ensures that the commits you claim to have made actually come from you, adding a layer of security and trust to the collaboration process. It helps others know that the code changes or contributions attributed to you are authentic and haven't been tampered with.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Commit signing practice helps prevent unauthorized changes and ensures the integrity of the codebase, making it a best practice for any team prioritizing security and accountability in their development workflows.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits</a></p>","excerpt":"Overview In git , when you are pushing code to origin a.k.a the remote server, out of the box, it uses email address and name to distinguishâ€¦","tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#overview\">Overview</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#conclusion\">Conclusion</a></li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Why commit signing is necessary","date":"2022-03-21T00:00:00.000Z","slug":"/blog/why-commit-signing-is-necessary/","tags":["git","security"],"cover_image":{"publicURL":"/static/6e83ffbb9fde0783221b30aa143b5704/cover.png"}}}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3115057458"],"slicesMap":{}}
