# Rubin Bhandari Uses (my favorite things)

Here are the tools I frequently use and enjoy the most. They help make my work more feasible, efficient, and enjoyable. (last updated 09/12/2024)

If you're interested in exploring other people's "Uses" pages, check out /uses, a project that gathers similar pages. It's worth browsing to see the tools others use and perhaps find some useful new ones yourself.

## Hardware & Accessories
[Acer Aspire 5 (2023)](https://www.gadgetbytenepal.com/acer-aspire-5-2023-price-nepal/) - My daily driver laptop. It's a great machine for the price.

[THOR II X16 V2](https://fantech.ph/product/x16-thor/) Mouse — I love the feel of this mouse. It's comfortable and has a great sensor.
